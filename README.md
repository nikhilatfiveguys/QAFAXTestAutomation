# QAFAX Test Automation

This repository delivers the minimal viable Fax QA automation CLI described in the
engineering plan. It now includes image-ready verification scaffolding, HP PC-Fax queue
submission hooks, ingest polling for print-scan workflows, and reproducible reporting
artifacts suitable for QA review packages.

## Features

- Seeded T.30 negotiation simulator with V.34/V.17 metadata and fallback logging
- Verification pipeline that loads text or images, applies optional preprocessing, and
  reports SSIM/PSNR/SKEW/NOISE/MTF/OCR/BARCODE/LINES metrics with policy-driven verdicts
- Content-aware page alignment that automatically reorders scans and offers a manual
  override prompt when confidence is low
- JSON/CSV/HTML reports, a plain-text run log, telemetry export, and a provenance manifest
  under `artifacts/<run-id>/`
- Configurable device profiles and verification policies loaded from `config/`
- Metadata capture for DID, HP PC-Fax queue submissions, ingest directory monitoring,
  optional SNMP snapshots, FoIP/T.38 validation attempts, and built-in T.38/USB modem
  transport timelines
- Optional self-test tool that checks for optional dependencies and environment readiness
- Optional PySide6 desktop UI for running the entire workflow without a browser

## First-Time Setup (Summary)

For the full walkthrough, see the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md). The condensed steps
below help you run the CLI quickly:

1. Install Python 3.11 or newer and clone this repository. Optional dependencies (NumPy,
   Pillow, pdf2image, OpenCV, scikit-image, PyWin32, pytesseract, pyzbar) unlock additional
   metrics and connectors but are not required for basic runs.
2. Create a virtual environment and install whichever optional packages you need:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install numpy Pillow pdf2image opencv-python scikit-image pywin32 pytesseract pyzbar
   ```

3. Validate your environment with the self-test utility:

   ```bash
   python -m app.tools.self_test
   ```

4. Run the CLI with a reference and candidate document:

   ```bash
   python -m app.main docs/samples/control_reference.txt docs/samples/control_candidate.txt \
     --iterations 3 --seed 42 --run-id demo
   ```

   Optional flags:

   - `--profile` / `--policy` to load different configuration files
   - `--path {digital|print-scan}` to record the path chips in reports (default: `digital`)
   - `--transport {sim|t38|modem}` to run the built-in transport encoder + timeline capture
   - `--did` to log the dialed DID
   - `--pcfax-queue` to attempt an HP PC-Fax submission (Windows + PyWin32 required)
   - `--t38-config` / `--modem-config` to point at driverless fax configuration JSON files
   - `--ingest-dir` / `--ingest-pattern` / `--ingest-timeout` / `--ingest-interval` to poll a
     scan folder for new artifacts after each run
   - `--snmp-target` / `--snmp-community` / `--snmp-oids` to collect printer counters via SNMP
   - `--foip-config` to execute a FoIP/T.38 validation workflow defined by a JSON config
   - `--require-ocr` and `--require-barcode` to promote optional metrics to hard gates

5. Inspect the generated artifacts under `artifacts/<run-id>/`:

   - `summary.json` — full run metadata, per-iteration metrics, optional ingest manifest,
     SNMP snapshots, FoIP results, and telemetry
   - `summary.csv` — iteration summaries suitable for spreadsheets
   - `report.html` — human-friendly view with chips and negotiation logs
   - `run.log` — text log of Phase B→D events for every iteration
   - `transport_timeline.csv` — optional timeline of built-in T.38/modem transport events
   - `provenance.json` — hashes, sizes, and ingest provenance for reproducibility
   - `telemetry.json` — structured telemetry emitted during execution

## Desktop GUI

Operators who prefer a Windows desktop experience can install `PySide6` when running
from source or use the packaged executable described below. To run the GUI directly
from Python:

```bash
pip install PySide6
python -m app.ui  # opens the QAFAX Desktop window
```

The desktop UI exposes the same options as the CLI: choose reference/candidate
documents, pick profiles and policies, configure transport (simulation, built-in
T.38, USB modem), toggle HP PC-Fax submission, ingest polling, SNMP snapshots,
and FoIP validation. Execution happens in a background thread so progress logs and
artifacts appear in the window without blocking the interface.

## Windows Executable Build

To distribute the desktop UI without requiring Python or manual dependency installs,
bundle it into a standalone `.exe` using PyInstaller. Build the executable from a
Windows environment where the optional feature libraries are installed (for example
`pip install PySide6 Pillow numpy pdf2image pytesseract pyzbar pyserial smbprotocol pywin32`).

```powershell
pip install pyinstaller
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build_windows_exe.ps1
```

The PowerShell helper invokes `PyInstaller` with `scripts/qafax_desktop.spec`, which
automatically collects the optional packages when present and embeds `config/` and
`docs/` so `dist/QAFAXDesktop/QAFAXDesktop.exe` runs on clean operator workstations
without additional downloads. Sign the resulting binary according to your deployment
policies before distribution.

## Configuration

Device profiles live under `config/profiles/`, verification policies under
`config/verify_policy.*.json`, FoIP samples in `config/foip.sample.json`, and
driverless fax transport templates in `config/fax/`. Each run records the
SHA-256 hash of the loaded profile and policy so operators can reproduce
results. Policies now include preprocessing preferences and optional metric
gates that can be tightened per site.

## Self-Test

Validate optional tooling and environment prerequisites with:

```bash
python -m app.tools.self_test
```

The tool writes `artifacts/self_test.json` with pass/fail results, including
checks for optional Python packages, HP PC-Fax queues, and FoIP/transport tools
(`t38modem`, `pjsua`).

## Testing

Basic unit tests cover configuration loading, simulation determinism, and report writers.
Run them with:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

## Roadmap

The CLI codebase is structured to grow into the full desktop application described in
`docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`. Stub packages (e.g., connectors, privacy, remote) remain in the
repository for future expansion.
